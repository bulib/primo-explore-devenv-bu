          This searchable bibliography of digitized books provides access to classic writings primarily in the history of 
          Protestant mission thought, including works on mission theology, theory, and strategy. Some of the books included 
          here were digitized in a 2009 collaboration between Boston University's 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bu.edu/sth/">School of Theology Library</a>, the 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bu.edu/cgcm/">Center for Global Christianity &amp; Mission</a>, and the 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.org/index.php">Internet Archive</a>, while others were digitized by other 
          bodies and have been identified by BU STH scholars as relevant to the history of missiology in the context of the 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bu.edu/missiology/">History of Missiology website</a>. The Boston University 
          School of Theology continues to work in collaboration with BU STH faculty to identify and digitize relevant works to 
          enrich this collection.

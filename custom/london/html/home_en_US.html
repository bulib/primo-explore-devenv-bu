          In a <strong>Basic Search</strong> you'll receive results that contain all of your search terms. These may match keywords in a title, 
          author names, subjects, abstract, or other descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>Use the <strong>Advanced Search</strong> instead to pre-limit to search only in specific fields, material types, and publication dates.</p>
        <p>
          Use the <strong>Filters</strong> to limit to items available online or physically available in library. You can also include or exclude 
          particular material types, dates, authors, subjects, or library locations.
        </p>
        <p>The <strong>*</strong> character can be used as a wildcard.</p>
        <p>Enclosing your search in quotes <strong>""</strong> will only return results with an exact match.</p>
        <p>Searches can also be nested in (), combined with "" and Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT.</p>

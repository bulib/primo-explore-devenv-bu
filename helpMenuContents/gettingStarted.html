<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  BU Libraries Search enables you to find books available in the BU Libraries, link to journals online, and discover scholarly articles 
  for your research.<br>

  See the <a>What’s in Search</a> section for a more detailed breakdown about the content types, collections, and materials not 
  available in search.<br><br> 
  BU Libraries Search also helps you manage your research by formatting citations, or by exporting to 
  citation managers such as Refworks, Zotero, and Mendeley. See the <a>Saving Results</a> and 
  <a>Citing Sources</a> sections for more detail.

<h2>Search Tips</h2>
<p>
  In a Basic Search you'll receive results that contain all of your search terms. These may match keywords in a title, author 
  names, subjects, abstract, or other descriptions.<br><br>
  Use the Advanced Search instead to pre-limit to search only in specific fields, material types, and publication dates.</p> 
<h3>Filtering Results</h3>
<p>Use the Filters to limit to items available online or physically available in library. You can also include or exclude particular material types, dates, authors, subjects, or library locations.</p>
<p>It's possible to lock in specific filters by first applying the filter, then clicking the lock icon to the left of the filter. Future searches will be automatically filtered to those results.

<h3>Constructing Search Queries</h3>
<p>The asterisk (*) character can be used as a wildcard in place of one or more characters. <br>
  <code>[Examples: recycl*, organiz*, hymn*]</code><br><br>

Enclosing your search in quotes "" will only return results with an exact match.<br> 
<code>[Examples: “global warming”, “Affordable Care Act”, “mutual funds”]</code><br><br>

Searches can also be nested in (), combined with "" and Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT.<br> 
<code>[Example: “World War II” AND (sites OR battles) NOT (Normandy OR Pearl Harbor)]</code></p>

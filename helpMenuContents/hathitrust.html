<h3>About the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS)</h3>
<p>The HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS) allows current BU students, faculty, and staff to have <strong>online reading access to selected materials that are in the BU Libraries but are currently unavailable due to the closure of the Libraries</strong>.</p>

<p>Faculty, students, and staff can access these materials via <a href="http://library.bu.edu/buls">BU Libraries Search</a>. Physical books in BU Libraries that are also available via HathiTrust will have a “<strong>Full Text Available at HathiTrust</strong>” link included in their records in BU Libraries Search.</p>

<p class="big-text"><strong>Access to these books is a multi-step process. Please follow the steps outlined below to read the books online.</strong></p>

<h3>How to Access Books via HathiTrust</h3>
<p>
  Faculty, students, and staff can access these materials via BU Libraries Search. Physical books in BU Libraries that are also available via 
  HathiTrust will have a “<strong>Full Text Available at HathiTrust</strong>” link included in their records in BU Libraries Search. 
  <em>(Note: This link will also be shown for out-of-copyright items; for those items the link will take you directly to the item without having to follow the steps below.)</em>

<p>
  After clicking on that link patrons need to log in to view the resources by selecting Boston University as the partner institution, 
  then clicking Continue to go to the BU Login.

<p>
  Books can be “checked out” to read online but cannot be downloaded. The checkout time is one hour. 
  Access will renew automatically at the end of that hour, unless another user requests the book after that hour is over. 
  The number of users who can check out a book at a time is based on how many physical copies of the book the Libraries have.
</p>
<p>
  <em>NOTE: If a book that is supposed to be available does not show the Temporary access link, log out of HathiTrust and log back in. (BU log-ins expire, but HathiTrust may not show that.)</em>

<h2>About BU Libraries 2 Go</h2>

<p>
  Boston University Libraries now offers a request and contactless pickup service for books and other circulating materials for research and study. 
  Stacks at all Libraries locations are closed to patrons until further notice and materials can only be accessed digitally or via BU Libraries 2 Go.
